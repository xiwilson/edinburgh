            <h2>Why Edinburgh?</h2>
            <h3>Edinburgh, Scotland's Capital</h3>
            <p>
              Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is a city that effortlessly
              blends history, culture, and breathtaking scenery. Nestled among
              rolling hills, its skyline is dominated by the majestic Edinburgh
              Castle, perched atop Castle Rock, offering panoramic views of the
              city below. The Old Town’s cobbled streets and medieval closes
              transport visitors back in time, while the elegant Georgian
              architecture of the New Town exudes a timeless charm. Arthur’s
              Seat, an ancient volcano and the highest point in Holyrood Park,
              provides a stunning natural retreat, rewarding hikers with
              unparalleled views of the city. Whether it’s the enchanting glow
              of the Christmas markets, the world-famous Edinburgh Festival
              Fringe, or the mesmerizing spectacle of the Royal Military Tattoo,
              the city’s vibrant atmosphere captivates all who visit.
